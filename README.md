# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis

Tasks :

Data Collection and Description 

Select a dataset that aligns with your interests and objectives for the text analysis. This could be from social media posts, product reviews, movie reviews or any other relevant source. 
Consider the following criteria:
Ensure the dataset is relevant to your area of study or interest.
Choose a readily accessible and publicly available dataset, preferably in a format suitable for analysis (for example, CSV or Excel).
Consider the size of the dataset and whether it is manageable for your analysis purposes.
Assess the quality of the dataset in terms of completeness, accuracy and reliability.
Once youâ€™ve chosen a dataset, provide a brief description of it, including its source, size and any relevant characteristics. 

Text Pre-Processing

Perform the following preprocessing steps on the collected text data:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation.
Perform tokenization.
Remove stop words.
Perform text normalization (stemming or lemmatization).

Data Exploration

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
Visualize the data using appropriate charts (such as bar charts or word clouds).
Provide insights based on the data exploration.

Sentiment Analysis 

Compare and select a sentiment analysis approach:
Lexicon-based method: Use a sentiment lexicon (pre-built list of words with associated sentiment) to classify tweets/reviews/feedback as positive, negative or neutral.
Machine learning method: Train a machine learning model (such as SVM or LSTM) on a labelled sentiment dataset to classify the tweets/reviews/feedback.

Analysis and Visualization 

Analyze the overall sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) of the tweets towards the campaign.
Identify the most frequently used words (bigrams or trigrams) associated with positive and negative sentiment.
Visualize the sentiment distribution using charts or graphs (such as word clouds or any relevant visualization).
